## Configuration

### Options

| Options   | Description                                                                     | Default   |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| `branchName` | The branch where the release is merged into. See [branchName](#branchName).  | develop   |
| `plugins` | Plugins defined here may stage files to be included in a back-merge commit. See [plugins](#plugins).   |  []  |
| `message` | The message for the back-merge commit (if files were changed by plugins. See [message](#message).   | `chore(release): Preparations for next release [skip ci]`     |

#### `branchName`

Branch name of the branch that should receive the back-merge. If none is given, the default value is used.

#### `plugins`

Use this if you have to make changes to the files for your development branch (e.g. setting a -dev version).
It uses the same plugin structure as semantic-release, but only trigger the "success" step after rebase from develop onto master is done and just before it is pushed.

*Note:* Please make sure that the files you changed are staged to Git workspace. Only then they will be committed.

#### `message`

The message for the back-merge commit is generated with [Lodash template](https://lodash.com/docs#template). The following variables are available:
